# Credit Risk Analysis
This project analyzes credit risk using Home Credit datasets (`application_data.csv` and `previous_application.csv`). 
I explored factors like loan type, family size, gender, and past applications to identify patterns in loan defaults.

## Key Features
- 11 visualizations (barplots, heatmaps, boxplots, etc.).
- Cleaned data by removing columns with >40% missing values.
- Key findings on risky clients and good candidates for loans.

## How to Run
1. Download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Upload to Google Colab.
3. Add `application_data.csv` and `previous_application.csv` from Kaggle.
4. Run all cells.
